Export GnuCash Sqlite database to QIF format

I've used GnuCash for a number of years and am generally happy with it, although of late I have experienced some frustrations. I would like to update my accounts from an iPad rather than on a full desktop PC, yet there are no good GnuCash iPad applications that I could find, and the closed-garden model of Apple seems to discourage any official port to iOS. Also, from my experience with using other accounts packages, I like the search bar function that filters the transactions in real-time allowing you to focus in on a specific category or type of transaction. The search facilities in GnuCash feel out-dated in comparison, infact the user interface in general is starting to feel a little dated.

With these in mind I thought I would try some other personal finance package to see if they meet my requirements, but was surprised to find a lack of export options, particular for the de-facto QIF standard.
